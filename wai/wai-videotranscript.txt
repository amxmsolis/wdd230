Welcome, My name is Monica Solis and I will talk about Web Accessibility.

0:00:12.734,0:00:18.234
The United Nations Agenda, pledging to “leave no one behind”.

0:00:19.034,0:00:30.634
According with United Nations, Accessibility is to enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life.

0:00:30.634,0:00:38.494
To ensure persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others.

0:00:38.581,0:00:44.032
Including information and communications technologies and systems.

0:00:47.567,0:00:57.200
People who have limited use of their arms, people who cannot hear or see well and people who process information differently,

0:00:57.234,0:01:02.134
should all be able to access and use web sites and applications.

0:01:02.167,0:01:08.100
Web technologies have many built in features for accessibility,

0:01:08.100,0:01:15.267
and we as web developers should know them so that we do not exclude any of our users.

0:01:19.067,0:01:25.034
When we develop for people with disabilities we are developing for all.

0:01:25.034,0:01:32.334
It is very important to remember that exists permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities.

0:01:32.334,0:01:33.700
For example:

0:01:33.700,0:01:37.967
A person with one arm has a permanent disability

0:01:37.967,0:01:43.167
A person with a broken arm has a temporary disability

0:01:43.167,0:01:49.800
A new parent holding a baby on one arm has a situational disability.

0:01:54.366,0:01:57.554
Groups of disabilities

0:01:57.943,0:02:01.084
Auditory - People with hearing loss.

0:02:01.720,0:02:10.792
Physical - People with limitations in their muscular control, sensations, joint disorders, or missing limbs.

0:02:12.267,0:02:15.577
Visual - People with reduced vision.

0:02:16.314,0:02:19.211
Cognitive, learning, and neurological

0:02:19.211,0:02:24.821
People that may have challenges understanding information.

0:02:25.190,0:02:28.726
Speech - Some people are not able to speak.

0:02:29.750,0:02:34.596
Let’s see some suggestions for supporting those groups of disabilities

0:02:37.852,0:02:47.295
Think of a well-developed website… now we will review it from a different point of view.

0:02:50.001,0:02:52.031
Auditory

0:02:52.891,0:02:59.244
Transcripts for audio and captions for video are great tools for supporting auditory disabilities.

0:02:59.592,0:03:03.696
In this example, we can see the option to download transcripts.

0:03:04.433,0:03:11.196
This option can also be very good for bad internet access.

0:03:14.841,0:03:16.022
Physical

0:03:16.022,0:03:22.064
People with disabilities use technology in a variety of ways.

0:03:22.377,0:03:23.964
Here are some examples:

0:03:23.964,0:03:27.721
People with hands tremors cannot grip a mouse.

0:03:27.721,0:03:30.080
They use the keyboard to navigate.

0:03:30.080,0:03:36.464
People with mobility disabilities use their voices to control the computer or mobile device.

0:03:36.648,0:03:42.698
People with mobility disabilities use eye tracking to move the screen cursor.

0:03:43.087,0:03:50.344
People with mobility disabilities use switch devices to operate the computer or mobile device.

0:03:51.025,0:03:57.869
People who are blind use screen readers, braille displays, or speech recognition software.

0:03:58.852,0:04:02.633
People with low vision use screen magnification.

0:04:02.940,0:04:11.428
Remember to support assistive technologies like switches and voice recognition and to have sufficient target sizes.

0:04:12.411,0:04:20.636
Target size is the size of an interactive element, the clickable or tappable area.

0:04:20.636,0:04:32.131
For example, on this screen, we can see a form that has a big input field and a big button for submission.

0:04:36.487,0:04:44.732
For People with reduced vision, make sure text and images can be enlarged, you use sufficient contrast,

0:04:44.834,0:04:52.698
that you do not rely on color alone, and that the content supports text-to-speech.

0:04:52.889,0:04:55.779
Let's see some examples.

0:05:00.000,0:05:01.256
Hyperopia

0:05:01.256,0:05:09.618
People with Hyperopia have difficulty focusing on objects at close range which makes them appear blurry.

0:05:09.802,0:05:11.264
Some suggestions are:

0:05:11.571,0:05:19.775
Avoid text in small font sizes and long texts. Use proper spacing and line height.

0:05:20.266,0:05:25.822
Make sure the website can be zoomed to at least 200%.

0:05:26.395,0:05:29.378
Also, Offer a text to speech reader.

0:05:32.797,0:05:34.724
Total color blindness

0:05:34.724,0:05:41.392
People with lowered color vision have difficulty distinguishing some or all colors.

0:05:41.392,0:05:46.893
Total color blindness or Monochromatic is very rare.

0:05:46.893,0:05:53.602
People with this visual impairment can not perceive any colors, only different shades of gray.

0:05:53.848,0:05:58.776
Make sure you have enough contrast between text and images.

0:06:01.602,0:06:03.602
Tunnel Vision

0:06:05.000,0:06:18.833
Is the loss of peripheral vision. This may be because the person suffers from a disease that affects the cells in the eye, but may also occur temporarily due to stress or depression.

0:06:19.202,0:06:25.502
Avoid text in small font sizes and long texts. Use proper spacing and line height.

0:06:25.645,0:06:33.378
 
Make sure the website can be zoomed to at least 200%.
Offer a text to speech reader.

0:06:33.378,0:06:37.753
[black screen]

0:06:37.753,0:06:43.157
For blind,  it is important to offer a text to speech reader.

0:06:45.818,0:06:48.391
Cognitive, learning, and neurological

0:06:48.391,0:06:53.851
People that may have challenges understanding information.

0:06:55.000,0:07:01.402
In this case, we can remember a clear structure, consistent labeling,

0:07:01.402,0:07:04.302
 predictable links and plain language.

0:07:04.650,0:07:10.213
This helps everyone regardless of ability or disability.

0:07:11.346,0:07:19.489
Dyslexia is a disability that makes it difficult for the brain to automate the interpretation of words.

0:07:20.238,0:07:25.325
This makes it hard for people with this disability to read and write.

0:07:25.635,0:07:30.503
Dyslexia has no connection with vision or intelligence.

0:07:30.637,0:07:34.353
The causes of dyslexia are still unclear.

0:07:35.944,0:07:37.432
Small vocabulary

0:07:38.279,0:07:48.674
A large part of the world's population can't read at all and many adults don't read as well as expected after finishing grade school.

0:07:48.674,0:07:57.189
To support those kinds of disabilities we can avoid text in small font sizes and long texts.

0:07:57.813,0:08:02.777
Use proper spacing and line-height.

0:08:02.861,0:08:04.541
Avoid difficult words and terms.

0:08:04.541,0:08:10.789
Offer easy-to-read texts, images, video, or audio alternatives.

0:08:10.789,0:08:15.284
Avoid fonts with complicated complex characters.

0:08:15.418,0:08:22.526
Offer texts in different languages.

0:08:22.526,0:08:24.526
Speech

0:08:24.526,0:08:31.614
Some people are not able to speak. Do not make your service voice-based only.

0:08:31.614,0:08:36.521
People with disabilities use technology in a variety of ways.

0:08:37.145,0:08:42.426
As developers, we do not need to code for a particular technology.

0:08:42.493,0:08:49.020
We use standard methods to make sure that our solution is accessible to all.

0:08:49.020,0:08:54.139
Some terms that we need to review to support those technologies are:

0:08:54.257,0:09:03.797
Visual Focus, Skip links, screen readers, forms, labels, autocomplete and error managing,

0:09:05.297,0:09:08.997
How to program for Accessibility?

0:09:09.435,0:09:12.801
[smile] Sorry I didn't show you any code.

0:09:12.952,0:09:21.544
I may suggest going to W3C, Mozilla Developer, and looking for Accessibility and you will find a lot of examples.

0:09:21.729,0:09:25.347
But I would like to say that for accessibility

0:09:25.482,0:09:27.562
we need to know our users,

0:09:27.680,0:09:31.568
we need to plan our website with a clear structure,

0:09:31.602,0:09:36.350
using meaningful images, plain language, good contrast,

0:09:36.518,0:09:41.407
support assistive technologies, and test our page code.

0:09:41.508,0:09:50.289
And for sure program with the best practices and update ourselves about new standards in coding and accessibility.

0:09:52.649,0:09:57.386
I share two great tools that support accessibility,

0:09:57.504,0:09:59.781
Web Disability Simulator

0:09:59.781,0:10:04.496
and Web Developer for chrome [in the option validates accessibility]

0:10:09.232,0:10:13.163
I take the information that I gave you from:

0:10:13.163,0:10:17.051
